# QuakeMarkers

Java Applet that marks where earthquakes have been detected recently.

This project was created by following the Object-Oriented Programming in Java course offered by UC San Diego through Coursera.

## Introduction

QuakeMarkers is an applet developed to visualize recent earthquake activity. It uses a Java version 8 and is compiled with JDK 1.6. The project follows the java object-oriented programming practices taught in the Coursera course.

## Getting Started

A basic Unfolding demo is available in the `src` folder. Unfolding Maps is a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations in Processing and Java.

For more examples and additional templates, visit the [Unfolding Maps website](http://unfoldingmaps.org/).

## Installation

To set up the project in Eclipse:

1. Go to `File` -> `Import` -> `Existing Projects into Workspace`.
2. Select this project folder and click `Finish`.

### Manual Installation

If the automatic import does not work, follow these manual steps:

1. Create a new Java project in Eclipse.
2. Copy and paste all files into the project directory.
3. Add all `.jar` files to the build path.
4. Set the native library location for jogl.jar (Java OpenGL Library) by choosing the appropriate folder for your operating system.
5. Add `data/` as the source folder.

## Module Folders

The module folders contain the starter code for the programming assignments associated with the course.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter VM problems, try switching the Java Compiler to 1.6. The Processing library should work with Java 1.6 and 1.7.
